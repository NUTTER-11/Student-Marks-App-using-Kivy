# Kivy Student Information App

## Overview

This project is a simple Kivy application designed to collect and display student information including name, marks, and gender. The app provides a basic user interface with text input fields and a button to print the entered data to the console.

## Files

### `main.py`

This script defines a Kivy application with a grid layout for inputting student information.

#### Dependencies

- `kivy`

#### Classes

**`childApp`**: A class representing the main layout of the application.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self, **kwargs)`: Initializes the layout with labels, text input fields, and a button. The layout has two columns and the following widgets:
    - `Label`: For prompting the user for student name, marks, and gender.
    - `TextInput`: For entering the student's name, marks, and gender.
    - `Button`: When pressed, triggers the `click_me` method to print the entered data to the console.
  - `click_me(self, instance)`: Prints the values entered in the text input fields to the console.

**`parentApp`**: A class that initializes the Kivy application.

- **Methods**:
  - `build(self)`: Builds and returns the main layout of the application by creating an instance of `childApp`.

#### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Kivy installed:
    ```bash
    pip install kivy
    ```

2. Run the script to start the Kivy application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The application window will appear with fields for entering the student's name, marks, and gender, along with a button labeled "click_me".

4. Enter data into the fields and click the "click_me" button. The entered information will be printed to the console.
